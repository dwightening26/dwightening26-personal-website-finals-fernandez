# dwight's personal website finals

A personal profile website built as a finals project for IT242. Designed and developed from scratch to represent who I am as a developer — combining clean UI, real-time backend features, and a range of interactive elements that go beyond the course requirements.

## Overview

This is a single-page React application that serves as my personal developer portfolio. It includes a full guestbook backed by Supabase, a custom music player, an interactive photo gallery, a tech stack showcase, a project list, and a personal journey timeline — all wrapped in a dark-mode-first design with custom cursor effects, scroll animations, and responsive layout.

The project was built iteratively with a focus on design quality, interactivity, and real-world frontend techniques. It is fully deployed on Vercel and uses Supabase as the backend-as-a-service layer for database operations.
